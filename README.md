# Adopt a Neighbor

## Notes

- uses create-react-app as a base
- incorporates a number of libraries aimed at developing UI for both mobile phone browsers and desktop, including react-multistep to keep the number of fields on each screen to a minimum
- now includes examples of how to use react-break library to render conditionally based on breakpoints. See the responsive-ui-utils.js file.
- added a pre-commit hook that will perform automatic code linting and prettier code formatting
